## keras_LLM_IMG
The neural network is trained on different types of images based on keras.

The neural network is trained on different types of images based on keras. 
For further training and use. The usage is as follows. The neural network loads the trained model 
and takes one image of yours to determine which type it belongs to. 
You can use video for training. I am continuing my work on it and continue to learn and improve it.

# auto_set_img.py  
Resizes the images in the pack to the specified sizes. The default is 128/128.

# neur_ai.py 	      
A neuron for image-based learning. Defaults to two types.

# neur_study.py     
Neuronka loads the trained model and takes an image to check which type it belongs to.
