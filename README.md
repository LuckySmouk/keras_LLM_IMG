## keras_LLM_IMG
Neural network for learning on different types of images based on keras. 

For further training and utilization. The utilization is as follows. The neural network loads the trained model 
and takes one image of yours to determine which type it belongs to. 
You can use video to train it. I continue to work on it and continue to learn and improve it.

# auto_set_img.py  
Resizes the images in the pack to the specified sizes. The default is 128/128.

# neur_ai.py 	      
A neuron for image-based learning. Defaults to two types.

# neur_study.py     
Neuronka loads the trained model and takes an image to check which type it belongs to.
